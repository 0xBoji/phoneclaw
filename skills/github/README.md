# GitHub

Use for GitHub-related requests without local shell execution:
- find repository/project
- check release/news/issues information from public pages
- compare repos at high level

## Workflow
1. Use `web_search` with explicit `site:github.com` queries.
2. Prefer repository canonical pages over mirrors.
3. Include link references in the answer.
4. If user asks to run git/gh commands, explain that this profile disables system-exec tools.
